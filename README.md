# sep788_project
This is the repository for committing the codes of our Sep788 Project - Chatbot. 
We are group2 - Wael Abdelkader and Aditya Goel

Design of our repository:

1. Branches - Based on various tasks - Eg. Preprocessing, Comparing competing approaches, Main Designing, Neural Network Training etc.
2. Commits will be made by both the developers on every branch as per their work done. However, the normal pattern is test codes committed by both forllowed by refining of code by both of us.
